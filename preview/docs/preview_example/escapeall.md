    ### Examples

    If you ever have to stop and try to remember, *Can I escape this char?* or
    *Will a backslash escape this?*, you are not alone.  EscapeAll makes `\`
    escape everything making such questions moot.  Now instead of questioning
    or looking up what can be escaped, you can expect that `\` will escape the
    character following it.  So if you need a literal `\`, just escape it:
    `\\`.  Keep in mind this will not escape things in code blocks of any kind.
