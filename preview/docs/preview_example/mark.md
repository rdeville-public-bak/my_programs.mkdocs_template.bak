    ### Examples

    Mark adds the ability to insert `#!html <mark></mark>` tags.  The syntax
    requires the text to be surrounded by double equal signs. It can optionally
    be configured to use smart logic. Syntax behavior for smart and non-smart
    variants of **mark** models that of BetterEm.

    To Mark some text, simply surround the text with double `=`.
